# HelloYeew's workflow setup

Here's the list of tool and setup that I use in my workflow.

## Note on my setup

Note that I work on many platform :
- MacOS (MacBook Pro) for web development, testing and when not working at home.
- Windows (PC) with Linux virtual machine for .NET development and testing stuff too. When I'm working at home I usually use this.
- iPad (iPad Pro) for speedy PR check and SSH connection.

That's why I try to make almost of every tool sync between these three devices so if some tool is only support on specific platform, I will note on it.

## Browser

I normally use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) as a primary browser since I use it for a long time and it's good for web development. (I use [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge) to but not much.)

### Theme

I use theme that I create from [loundraw's illustration from 君は月夜に光り輝く](https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/61606801) with my personal customized color.

Download : [You Shine in the Moonlit Night](theme/You-Shine-in-the-Moonlit-Night.crx)

### Homepage

As you see from the theme preview image, I use my customized self-host homepage since I want to use this homepage on every device.

- [mamizu](https://github.com/HelloYeew/mamizu) : Fork of [Flame](https://github.com/pawelmalak/flame) that I add some of my customization to make it looking same as my theme and some of my personal customization.
- [Custom New Tab URL](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-new-tab-url/mmjbdbjnoablegbkcklggeknkfcjkjia) : Without this extension I cannot set mamizu as my chrome homepage.
